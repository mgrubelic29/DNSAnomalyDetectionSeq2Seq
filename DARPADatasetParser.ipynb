Current software and techniques used to defend against these malicious attacks are showing their limitations and are being completely overwhelmed in some cases. As a result, a more modern and forwardthinking solution is becoming increasingly necessary. The team is implementing one such software solution using a sequence to sequence neural network in Python3 with the Pytorch library to observe malicious events and predict when the next attack might happen. In this project, a deep learning sequence to sequence model, modeled after behavior of predictive typing technologies, was implemented on the CICIDS 2017 dataset to detect malicious DNS traffic and determine the probability of another attack in the future. The model functions by observing sequences of network packets, using them to predict upcoming sequences of packets, and comparing the actual observed data to the prediction. Since the amount of notable research and experimentation done in this area so far is lacking, the results yielded by this network traffic anomaly detection approach further demonstrate that the use of a sequence to sequence model is a viable, though still emerging, solution for modern intrusion detection systems.\n","\n","  Goal: To leverage machine learning techniques to automatically detect anomalous traffic using the DNS protocol. The project seeks to eliminate the need for manual examination of suspicious log files by allowing a machine learning algorithm to make decisions. The machine learning algorithm will use an unsurpervised learning model that is trained off of known data and then compares this data to unknown, live DNS data."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ManwvmPldEtK","colab_type":"code","outputId":"29695e18-94eb-4a4f-bb0f-0fb07dac1683","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1586792016594,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":10712,"user":{"displayName":"matt

The reason this is a DataFrame is because, DataFrames are the most useful and take up the smallest amount of memory. Using regular arrays led to Random Access Memory (RAM) overloads, Google runtime resets, and on a worst case scenario, computer resets. The DataFrames are also useful because they allow you to label the rows and columns of the information that is being processed. Continuing through the function, there are a set of rules that have been added to keep the function running properly and to make sure that we obtain the correct information. The rules are as follows: \n","\n","1. If the Source IP does not match the Source IP of the first packet in the sequence, the function will break\n","2. If the Destination IP does not match the Destination IP of the first packet in the sequence, the function will break\n","3. If the length of the sequences are less than 3 packets total, they will not be included into the final DataFrame. This is because the small number of packets will not be sufficent enough to produce an accurate prediction of the sequences to follow.\n","4. If the current packet did not take place within 1 second of the first packet in the sequence, the function will break.\n","\n","These four rules are the most important for the successful completion of the program. Once these requirements are met, then the function will start generating the sequences that are present in the data set and put them into a  labeled DataFrame. The counter on the last line will then keep track of the number of packets that are present in each sequence that it encounters. This will be helpful later in predicting future sequences. The more packets that are present in a sequence, the more accurate the prediction will be. Finally, this function will return a value - the number of packets present in the sequence and a DataFrame - the labeled sequence."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"wGRMFQE86Xhe","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":238},"outputId":"dbe378bb-38c7-4cc2-f4c2-08f7c371a926","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1588713155533,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":2920,"user":{"displayName":"matt grubelic","photoUrl":"","userId":"01972506599351293987"}}},"source":["from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import time\n","import os \n","import psutil\n","\n","pd.set_option('display.width', 1000)\n","pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\n","pd.set_option('mode.chained_assignment', None)\n","\n","# DATA PREPROCESSING------------------------------------------------------------\n","data = pd.read_csv(\"/content/week1mon.csv\", delimiter=',', header=0, quotechar='\"')\n","print(data['Protocol'].value_counts())\n","\n","# Gets the next input sequence of packets\n","def get_sequence(pos, input_data):\n","    t1 = input_data[pos][1]  # Timestamp of the first packet in the sequence\n","    src1 = input_data[pos][2]  # Source IP of the first packet in the sequence\n","    num_packets = 0  # Store the number of packets in the sequence\n","    sequence = []\n","\n","    # loop to parse generate sequences \n","    for x in range(pos, pos + 320):\n","        # if packet does not have the same source or destination IP as the source of the first one in the sequence\n","        if (input_data[x][2] != src1 and input_data[x][3] != src1 and len(sequence)>3):\n","            break\n","        # if the current one did not happen within 1 second of the first one in the sequence\n","        elif ((input_data[x][1]-t1)>1 and len(sequence)>3):\n","            break\n","        else:\n","            row = input_data[x]\n","            sequence.append(row)  # Append the sequence with the current packet\n","            num_packets = num_packets + 1  # Update the number of packets\n","\n","    return num_packets, sequence"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["TCP         694190\n","TELNET      347037\n","SSHv1        78556\n","HTTP         69898\n","SMTP         40030\n","FTP-DATA      7690\n","FTP           5575\n","SMTP|IMF      2303\n","IRC           1200\n","POP            470\n","FINGER         377\n","TIME            40\n","Name: Protocol, dtype: int64\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GJj8J_Pn6F7X","colab_type":"text"},"source":["This small block of code is used to condense the number of unique protocols contained in the dataset by combining similar protocols and dropping unwanted or unnecessary ones.

the values of the flags to 1's and 0's rather than the text \"Set\" or \"Not set\". The column value is set to 1 if the flag is set, and 0 if the flag is not set. Having columns with numerical values rather than text-based values helps reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, as one-hot encoding would have to be used otherwise and would result in 2 columns for each flag. Additionally, numerical values are markedly easier to work with and interpret when training a machine learning

This is where the function described above will be used and where the filtered dataset that was previously read in will be split between train and test data. The train data is the data that we will use to model the program with. Then the test data will be the part of the data that we will use to test the prediction functions. Furthermore, after the split between the train and test data, the train data is than made into an np.array - an array that contains any object - which we are able to use in the DataFrame. Our DataFrame as of right now is comprised of 18 total columns:\n","1. Frame Number (No.)\n","2. Time\n","3. Source IP\n","4. Destination IP\n","5. Protocol\n","6. Length (bytes)\n","7. Source Port\n","8. Destination Port\n","9. Reserved flag\n","10. Nonce flag\n","11. Congestion Window Reduced flag\n","12. ECN flag\n","13. Urgent flag\n","14. Acknowledgment flag\n","15. Push flag\n","16. Reset flag\n","17. Synchronization flag\n","18. Finish flag\n","\n","These 18 columns are currently being used as the labels in the DataFrame which we will either add or take away from as we feel necessary. Continuing into the while loop, this is where the program starts working. The rules for this loop are as follows:\n","1. If the counting variable exceeds the length of the filtered train data array, the loop will be broken.\n","2. If the length of the filtered train data array subtracted by the count is greater than 3, the loop will break. \n","\n","Rule 2 happens due to the fact that we took away any sequences that are smaller than three packets. This means it is possible that the count will reach a number smaller than the length of the filtered train data array but have no more data to run through. This rule avoids the possibility of the loop going out of bounds. Furthermore, after each sequence is found, the loop will inform the user how many packets are inside the sequence, it will print the sequence to the screen for the user to see, and will also inform the user on the number of sequences it has processed. After all sequences have been accounted for and the loop breaks, the program will then print the time of execution in seconds and end."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"dsvoL4RlOPKe","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Split into train, test data\n","train, test = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.33, random_state=0, shuffle=False)\n","print(\"Train: \\n\", train)\n","data = np.array(train)\n","\n","# Get all of the sequences\n","count = 1  # Store the total number of processed packets\n","\n","num_sequences = 0  # Store the total number of sequences\n","\n","all_sequences_df = pd.DataFrame(\n","    columns=[\"No.\", \"timestamp\", \"src_ip\", \"dst_ip\", \"protocol\", \"length\", \"src_port\", \"dst_port\",\n","             \"res\", \"ns\", \"cwr\", \"ecn\", \"urg\", \"ack\", \"push\", \"reset\", \"syn\", \"fin\"])\n","\n","start_time = time.time()\n","\n","\n","while (count < len(data) and len(data)-count>3):\n","    num_packets, sequence = get_sequence(count, data)  # Get the next sequence\n","    count = count + num_packets  # Update the number of processed packets\n","\n","    sequence_df = pd.DataFrame(data=sequence, columns = [\"No.\", \"timestamp\", \"src_ip\", \"dst_ip\", \"protocol\", \"length\", \"src_port\", \"dst_port\",\n","                                                          \"res\", \"ns\", \"cwr\", \"ecn\", \"urg\", \"ack\", \"push\", \"reset\", \"syn\", \"fin\"])\n","    print('Number of packets in sequence: ', num_packets)\n","    print(\"Sequence: \\n\", sequence_df)\n","    all_sequences_df = all_sequences_df.append(sequence_df)\n","\n","    num_sequences = num_sequences + 1  # Update the number of sequences\n","    print(\"Sequence Number: \", num_sequences)\n","    print(\"=========================================================\\n\")\n","\n","print(\"\\n\\n\\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\")\n","print(\"-----> FINISHED READING SEQUENCES <-----\")\n","print(\"Time of Execution: %s seconds\" % (time.time() - start_time))"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Vq8fMebf17Zs","colab_type":"text"},"source":["After all of the above steps have taken place, the following code snippet saves the DataFrame which will then be saved to the system for the user to have an accessible copy."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"i4HS1mptmfwE","colab_type":"code","outputId":"f7a67386-5b0a-47b4-b81c-f95ca5d9dc53","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1586666908160,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":4729,"user":{"displayName":"Chris Saliby","photoUrl":"","userId":"02008656896127910157"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":280}},"source":["print(all_sequences_df)\n","\n","#convert dataframe to csv file \n","sequenceCSV = all_sequences_df.to_csv(\"/content/testing_sequences.csv\")"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["       No.     timestamp          src_ip          dst_ip protocol length src_port dst_port res ns cwr ecn urg ack push reset syn fin\n","0       49     37.294817  172.16.113.105   196.37.75.158      TCP     60       79     1024   0  0   0   0   0   1    0     0   1   0\n","1       50     37.295017   196.37.75.158  172.16.113.105      TCP     60     1024       79   0  0   0   0   0   1    0     0   0   0\n","2       51     37.295563   196.37.75.158  172.16.113.105      TCP     60     1024       79   0  0   0   0   0   1    1     0   0   0\n","3       52     37.307251  172.16.113.105   196.37.75.158      TCP     60       79     1024   0  0   0   0   0   1    0     0   0   0\n","4       54     37.327150  172.16.113.105   196.37.75.158      TCP     60       79     1024   0  0   0   0   0   1    0     0   0   0\n","..     ...           ...             ...             ...      ...    ...      ...      ...  .. ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ...   ...  ..  ..\n","3   866516  25638.793159  172.16.112.194   194.7.248.153   TELNET    922       23    13416   0  0   0   0   0   1    1     0   0   0\n","0   866517  25638.796071   172.16.113.84   195.73.151.50      TCP     60    15037       23   0  0   0   0   0   1    0     0   0   0\n","1   866518  25638.796307  172.16.114.169  196.227.33.189   TELNET     60    17258       23   0  0   0   0   0   1    1     0   0   0\n","2   866519  25638.796780  196.227.33.189  172.16.114.169   TELNET     60       23    17258   0  0   0   0   0   1    1     0   0   0\n","3   866520  25638.811022   194.7.248.153  172.16.112.194      TCP     60    13416       23   0  0   0   0   0   1    0     0   0   0\n","\n","[826566 rows x 18 columns]\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
