        "  The risk of crippling cyber attacks on computer systems is increasing rapidly each day. Current software and techniques used to defend against these malicious attacks are showing their limitations and are being completely overwhelmed in some cases. As a result, a more modern and forwardthinking solution is becoming increasingly necessary. The team is implementing one such software solution using a sequence to sequence neural network in Python3 with the Pytorch library to observe malicious events and predict when the next attack might happen. In this project, a deep learning sequence to sequence model, modeled after behavior of predictive typing technologies, was implemented on the CICIDS 2017 dataset to detect malicious DNS traffic and determine the probability of another attack in the future. The model functions by observing sequences of network packets, using them to predict upcoming sequences of packets, and comparing the actual observed data to the prediction. Since the amount of notable research and experimentation done in this area so far is lacking, the results yielded by this network traffic anomaly detection approach further demonstrate that the use of a sequence to sequence model is a viable, though still emerging, solution for modern intrusion detection systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Goal: To leverage machine learning techniques to automatically detect anomalous traffic using the DNS protocol. The project seeks to eliminate the need for manual examination of suspicious log files by allowing a machine learning algorithm to make decisions. The machine learning algorithm will use an unsurpervised learning model that is trained off of known data and then compares this data to unknown, live DNS data."

The for loop in this section will display the name and the bytes of the file so that the user of the program knows that the file has uploaded successfully.

        "  Continuing on to the first major piece of the program code, the following snippet mainly processes the data and shows defines a function that will be used later in main(). The beginning of this snippet reads in the data from the previously uploaded file and reads in the file row by row. This allows us to extract the most important bits of information that is held inside the CSV file. After the information is completely read in, the column that displays the protocol type is then filtered to only produce the 'TCP' protocols and insert them into their own array. This will later be a filter that is included so the user can look for any protocol that is present in the CSV file.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moving on to the newly defined function, this function takes in two values. The first is the position of where we are going to start looking in the previously defined protocol array. The second is the DataFrame that we want to look at. The reason this is a DataFrame is because, DataFrames are the most useful and take up the smallest amount of memory. Using regular arrays led to Random Access Memory (RAM) overloads, Google runtime resets, and on a worst case scenario, computer resets. The DataFrames are also useful because they allow you to label the rows and columns of the information that is being processed. Continuing through the function, there are a set of rules that have been added to keep the function running properly and to make sure that we obtain the correct information. The rules are as follows: \n",
        "\n",
        "1. If the Source IP does not match the Source IP of the first packet in the sequence, the function will break\n",
        "2. If the Destination IP does not match the Destination IP of the first packet in the sequence, the function will break\n",
        "3. If the length of the sequences are less than 3 packets total, they will not be included into the final DataFrame. This is because the small number of packets will not be sufficent enough to produce an accurate prediction of the sequences to follow.\n",
        "4. If the current packet did not take place within 1 second of the first packet in the sequence, the function will break.\n",
        "\n",
        "These four rules are the most important for the successful completion of the program. Once these requirements are met, then the function will start generating the sequences that are present in the data set and put them into a  labeled DataFrame. The counter on the last line will then keep track of the number of packets that are present in each sequence that it encounters. This will be helpful later in predicting future sequences. The more packets that are present in a sequence, the more accurate the prediction will be. Finally, this function will return a value - the number of packets present in the sequence and a DataFrame - the labeled sequence."

        "The following snippet of code is the main part of the program. This is where the function described above will be used and where the filtered dataset that was previously read in will be split between train and test data. The train data is the data that we will use to model the program with. Then the test data will be the part of the data that we will use to test the prediction functions. Furthermore, after the split between the train and test data, the train data is than made into an np.array - an array that contains any object - which we are able to use in the DataFrame.

This means it is possible that the count will reach a number smaller than the length of the filtered train data array but have no more data to run through. This rule avoids the possibility of the loop going out of bounds. Furthermore, after each sequence is found, the loop will inform the user how many packets are inside the sequence, it will print the sequence to the screen for the user to see, and will also inform the user on the number of sequences it has processed. After all sequences have been accounted for and the loop breaks, the program will then print the time of execution in seconds and end."
